I don't have a ton of experinece in embedded systems, the only similar class
that I have taken was CS3501: Embedded Computing and Robotics 1.

I am interested in learning more about embedded systems as I have a background
in software and would like to learn more about the hardware side of things.
I am interested in autonomous systems and computer vision.
