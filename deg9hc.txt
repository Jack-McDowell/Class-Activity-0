Background: As a computer engineer, I've had plenty of experience with embedded systems projects, from building a personal weather station in an internship to designing a handheld mobile robot in class. This is my fourth class on embedded computing systems at UVA, along with several other classes on digital logic design, computer architecture, autonomous mobile robotics, and operating systems. I've done projects with boards as simple as the Arduino and as advanced as the MSP432, often using Python and C for programming.
Interests: My interests include machine learning and autonomous mobile robtoics. I hope to learn more about the uses and design of real-time operating systems for embedded systems. I think knowing how to build a RTOS is becoming incredibly important as companies want their products to have intelligent, real-time solutions for their customers, so I look forward to the projects in this class.
